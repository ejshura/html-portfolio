<h1>The Best Movies of All Time According to Ethan</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>Nerve (2016)</h3>
<p>A story about an anonymous online game of Truth or Dare, without the Truth. This movie has a great soundtrack and makes incredible use of lighting and camera work to further add to suspensful moments.</p>
<h3>Nick and Norah's Infinite Playlist (2008)</h3>
<p>A journey through New York's indie rock scene creates a fate encounter for two teens. I love the soundtrack and the characters are super funny and relatable.</p>
<h3>Project X (2012)</h3>
<p>The story of a high school kid who sets out to throw the greatest party of all time. Great music, incredible camera work, and the movie really takes you along for the ride.</p>
